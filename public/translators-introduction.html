  <h1>Translator's introduction</h1>
  <h3>By David Kim, Chloe Tsang, Jacob Santiago, Aslan Cheng <h3>
    <p>
      Science fiction has not always been a mainstream genre in China. With the presence of influential writers like Issac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, and pioneers like, Mary Shelley and Jules Verne, science fiction is established as a much sophisticated and popular genre in the Western world. In the words of the Chinese author Fei Dao, [...] Chinese science fiction was like a “hidden lonely army . . . laid low in the wilderness where nobody really cared to look at it” (MingWei Song 2018, 11). </p>
      <p>
        However, Liu Cixin, a Chinese science fiction writer, and his most well-known, Hugo award-winning work, The Three-Body Problem, changed it all. Its domestic and international popularity has attracted Chinese people’s attention again to the genre of science fiction, bringing it back to the mainstream, though there is still a lack of high-quality works present in the genre. Most sci-fi fans are still ignorant of any other works, even those written by, and representative of Liu Cixin. The Village Teacher is one of the best among them.

      <p>
      Liu Cixin tends to purposely avoid areas of writing that are explicitly political and has said as much in interviews, whereas his peers in the field are more likely to include political messages within their stories. Science fiction as a genre usually tends to focus on concepts such as utopia, technology, and some greater external forces. Cixin’s works mostly focus on these ideas, but prefer a more “post-human” concept where life forms past realistic human concepts are a part of the story. Although Liu is an advocate of “hard science fiction”, The Village Teacher is a “soft science fiction”, a story with humanistic concern rather than focusing on technological fantasies and scientific theories. Focusing on the “bleak” state of education in rural China, Liu Cixin’s The Village Teacher not only portrays the overall state of rural cities in China through few but realistic characters but also conveys the universal significance of the crucial role of teachers and education has played in the history of humankind to the future generation through the dramatic contrast portrayed in the dual storyline Liu delicately sets up.

      The story of The Village Teacher revolves around multiple settings, one being on Earth and one being in space. Under the context of rural hollowing due to rapid urbanization in the early 1990s, the story introduces a small remote mountain village in China where farming and education are on the decline and many suffer from poverty. A schoolteacher in that village diagnosed with cancer cannot afford his treatment. The space setting then introduces and narrates short scuffles of space wars between the higher life forms. Carbon-based Federation and the Silicon-based Empire which transitions into a space politics action where a parliament between intergalactic civilizations needs to decide to “sacrifice the lives of the lower life forms… to save the greater part of the galaxy’s higher and lower life forms” during wartime. Then it is implied and later confirmed that these higher life forms will test Earth’s knowledge like they have other planets to decide whether to destroy it or not. The passage that we specifically focus on goes into scenes where children of the village are being taught by the slowly dying schoolteacher, unbeknownst to the impending test. For the story succeeding the passage, the higher life forms randomly land on the earth, giving the “3C Civilization Test”  to check for the level of technology and intelligence their civilization has reached, and the children are too stunned and fail to answer many of the first questions, but then they remember the teachings of the recently passed schoolteacher when the test begins reciting physics-based questions and the extraterrestrials spare the planet from total annihilation. The ending of the story makes an emotional and surprising reaction to the existence of humans as the aliens compare the primitive nature of human learning, all facilitated by the schoolteacher.
