  <h1>The Village Teacher</h1>
  <h3>By Cixin Liu </h3>
  <p>
    He gave up trying to write on the blackboard, as his hand waved feebly, asking a kid to take the blackboard away for him. He began to speak, voice as faint as a thread. 

	“Today’s lesson, like the ones in the past two days, is a lesson designed for middle school students. The syllabus did not originally require it, but as I believe that most of you will never have the opportunity to hear middle school lessons in your entire life, I am giving my last words to let you know what deeper knowledge looks like. Yesterday we talked about Lu Xun’s “A Madman’s Diary”, which you probably don’t understand, but regardless, you should reread it multiple times, and better memorize it, as when you grow up, you will understand. Lu Xun is a remarkable man, his books every Chinese should read, as you all should in the future. 

Tired, he stopped to rest and breathe, glancing at the flickering candlelight, Lu Xun’s few writings flashed across his mind. Those weren’t in “A Madman’s Diary”, nor in the textbook. He read them from his incomplete and worn-out collection of Lu Xun’s works. When he reads it the very first time, those words remain deeply engraved in his mind.

“Suppose an iron house that lacks windows and is extremely hard to destroy, inside there are many people in deep sleep, in no time will suffocate to death, yet it’s from deep slumber to death, not feeling the sorrow of death. Now you shout, awakening several relatively sober people, making the unfortunate few suffer from inevitable agony on the verge of death, you rather think you have no guilt for them?”

“Yet as few get up, you cannot say that there is definitely no hope of destroying this iron house.” 

He used his last strength to continue.

“Today we will talk about middle-school physics. You probably haven’t heard of physics, it’s about the principles of the material world, a deep, deep subject.

“This lesson is about Newton's Three Laws. Newton was a great British scientist, who said three sentences. These three sentences are very powerful in that they encompass the laws governing everything on earth and in heaven, from the sun and the moon to the flowing water and blowing wind, none can escape the boundaries outlined by these three sentences. Using these three sentences, one can calculate the time of the solar eclipse, which is about SkyDog Eating the Moon olds’ saying, without a minute or a second of deviation; humans fly to the moon, also rely upon these three sentences. These are Newton’s three laws.”

“Next we talk about the first law: when an object is not acted upon by an external force, it will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unchanged.”

The kids quietly looked at him in the candlelight, with no response.

“That is to say, if you push hard on that stone grinder on the threshing floor, it will roll continuously, rolling to the edge of the sky without stopping. BaoZhu, what are you laughing at? Yes, it surely wouldn’t do that, this is because of the presence of friction, friction stops it, in this world, a frictionless environment is nonexistent…”

That’s right, the friction of his life is too great. In the village, he is an outsider, barely carrying any weight to begin with, plus his stubborn temper has offended the entire village in all these years. He went from family to family to bring their kids to school, traveling to the county to bring back the kid helping his father with business, patting on his chest, promising to cover the tuition for them… All of this hadn’t won much appreciation, the key is, his views about living are drastically different from the people around him, what he thought and spoke all day, were all unrealistic things, it’s the most annoying part. Before he was diagnosed with the illness, he even went to the county, getting a sum of money from the education bureau to repair the school. The village merely took a small portion of it, hoping to invite a theatrical troupe to sing for a few days, but he interfered, bringing the deputy county mayor over to ask the village to give the money back, even as the stage was already built. While the school was repaired, he upset the entire village, making future days more difficult. First, the electrician in the village, the nephew of the village head, cut off the school’s electricity, followed by the village stopping to provide straw for cooking and heating, causing him to leave his land unfarmed and collect firewood in the mountain, not to mention the subsequent event of tearing down woods on the school building… These frictional forces are everywhere, making him exhausted and unable to achieve uniform motion in a straight line. He had to stop.

Perhaps, the world he is going to is frictionless. Everything there would be smooth, but what’s the point of that? Over there, his heart would stay in the world full of dust and friction, in the rural elementary school in which he put all of his life. After he is gone, the other two teachers will also leave, this little school that he pushes with his strength in his life will stop just like the stone grinder on the threshing floor. He fell into deep sorrow, but no matter in this world or that world, he had no power to save it.
