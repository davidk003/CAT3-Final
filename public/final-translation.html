  <h1>The Village Teacher</h1>
  <h3>By Cixin Liu </h3>
  <p>
    He gave up trying to write on the blackboard, as his hand waved feebly, asking a kid to take the blackboard away for him. He began to speak, voice as faint as a thread. 

	Today’s lesson, like the ones in the past two days, is a lesson designed for middle school students. The syllabus did not originally require it, but as I believe that most of you will never have the opportunity to hear middle school lessons in your entire life, I am giving my last words to let you know what deeper knowledge looks like. Yesterday we talked about Lu Xun’s “A Madman’s Diary”, which you probably don’t understand, but regardless, you should reread it multiple times, and better memorize it, as when you grow up, you will understand. Lu Xun is a remarkable man, his books every Chinese should read, as you all should in the future. 

Tired, he stopped to rest and breathe, glancing at the flickering candlelight, Lu Xun’s few writings flashed across his mind. Those weren’t in “A Madman’s Diary”, nor in the textbook. He read them from his incomplete and worn-out collection of Lu Xun’s works. When he reads it the very first time, those words remain deeply engraved in his mind.

“Suppose an iron house that lacks windows and is extremely hard to destroy, inside there are many people in deep sleep, in no time will suffocate to death, yet it’s from deep slumber to death, not feeling the sorrow of death. Now you shout, awakening several relatively sober people, making the unfortunate few suffer from inevitable agony on the verge of death, you rather think you have no guilt for them?”

“Yet as few get up, you cannot say that there is definitely no hope of destroying this iron house.” 

He used his last strength to continue.

“Today we will talk about middle-school physics. You probably haven’t heard of physics, it’s about the principles of the material world, a deep, deep subject.

“This lesson is about Newton's Three Laws. Newton was a great British scientist, who said three sentences. These three sentences are very powerful in that they encompass the laws governing everything on earth and in heaven, from the sun and the moon to the flowing water and blowing wind, none can escape the boundaries outlined by these three sentences. Using these three sentences, one can calculate the time of the solar eclipse, which is about SkyDog Eating the Moon olds’ saying, without a minute or a second of deviation; humans fly to the moon, also rely upon these three sentences. These are Newton’s three laws.”

“Next we talk about the first law: when an object is not acted upon by an external force, it will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unchanged.”

The kids quietly looked at him in the candlelight, with no response.

“That is to say, if you push hard on that stone grinder on the threshing floor, it will roll continuously, rolling to the edge of the sky without stopping. BaoZhu, what are you laughing at? Yes, it surely wouldn’t do that, this is because of the presence of friction, friction stops it, in this world, a frictionless environment is nonexistent…”

That’s right, the friction of his life is too great. In the village, he is an outsider, barely carrying any weight to begin with, plus his stubborn temper has offended the entire village in all these years. He went from family to family to bring their kids to school, traveling to the county to bring back the kid helping his father with business, patting on his chest, promising to cover the tuition for them… All of this hadn’t won much appreciation, the key is, his views about living are drastically different from the people around him, what he thought and spoke all day, were all unrealistic things, it’s the most annoying part. Before he was diagnosed with the illness, he even went to the county, getting a sum of money from the education bureau to repair the school. The village merely took a small portion of it, hoping to invite a theatrical troupe to sing for a few days, but he interfered, bringing the deputy county mayor over to ask the village to give the money back, even as the stage was already built. While the school was repaired, he upset the entire village, making future days more difficult. First, the electrician in the village, the nephew of the village head, cut off the school’s electricity, followed by the village stopping to provide straw for cooking and heating, causing him to leave his land unfarmed and collect firewood in the mountain, not to mention the subsequent event of tearing down woods on the school building… These frictional forces are everywhere, making him exhausted and unable to achieve uniform motion in a straight line. He had to stop.

Perhaps, the world he is going to is frictionless. Everything there would be smooth, but what’s the point of that? Over there, his heart would stay in the world full of dust and friction, in the rural elementary school in which he put all of his life. After he is gone, the other two teachers will also leave, this little school that he pushes with his strength in his life will stop just like the stone grinder on the threshing floor. He fell into deep sorrow, but no matter in this world or that world, he had no power to save it.

  <h1>乡村教师</h1>
  <h3>刘慈欣</h3>
<p>他放弃了在黑板上写字的努力，无力地挥了一下手，让一个娃把黑板拿走。他开始说话，声音如游丝一般。

    “今天的课同前两天一样，也是初中的课。这本来不是教学大纲上要求的，我是想到，你们中的大部分人，这一辈子永远也听不到初中的课了，所以我最后讲一讲，也让你们知道稍深一些的学问是什么样子。昨天讲了鲁迅的《狂人日记》，你们肯定不大懂，不管懂不懂都要多看几遍，最好能背下来，等长大了，总会懂的。鲁迅是个很了不起的人，他的书每一个中国人都应该读读的，你们将来也一定找来读读。”
    
    他累了，停下来喘息着歇歇，看着跳动的烛光，鲁迅写下的几段文字在他的脑海中浮现出来。那不是《狂人日记》中的，课本上没有，他是从自己那套本数不全已经翻烂的鲁迅全集上读到的，许多年前读第一遍时，那些文字就深深地刻在他脑子里。
    
    “假如一间铁屋子，是绝无窗户而万难破毁的，里面有许多熟睡的人们，不久都要闷死了，然而是从昏睡入死灭，并不感到就死的悲哀。现在你大嚷起来，惊起了较为清醒的几个人，使这不幸的少数者来受无可挽救的临终的苦楚，你倒以为对得起他们么？”
    
    “然而几个人既然起来，你不能说决没有毁坏这铁屋的希望。”
    
    他用尽最后的力气，接着讲下去。
    
    “今天我们讲初中物理。物理你们以前可能没有听说过，它讲的是物质世界的道理，是一门很深很深的学问。”
    
    “这课讲牛顿三定律。牛顿是从前的一个英国大科学家，他说了三句话，这三句话很神的，它把人间天上所有的东西的规律都包括进去了，上到太阳月亮，下到流水刮风，都跑不出这三句话划定的圈圈。用这三句话，可以算出什么时候日食，就是村里老人说的天狗吃太阳，一分一秒都不差的；人飞上月球，也要靠这三句话，这就是牛顿三定律。”
    
    “下面讲第一定律：当一个物体没有受到外力作用时，它将保持静止或匀速直线运动不变。”
    
    娃们在烛光中默默地看着他，没有反应。
    
    “就是说，你猛推一下谷场上那个石碾子，它就一直滚下去，滚到天边也不停下来。宝柱你笑什么？是啊，它当然不会那样，这是因为有磨擦力，磨擦力让它停下来，这世界上，没有磨擦力的环境可是没有的……”
    
    是啊，他人生的磨擦力就太大了。在村里他是外姓人，本来就没什么分量，加上他这个倔脾气，这些年来把全村人都得罪下了。他挨家挨户拉人家的娃入学，跑到县里，把跟着爹做买卖的娃拉回来上学，拍着胸脯保证垫学费……这一切并没有赢得多少感激，关键在于，他对过日子看法同周围人太不一样，成天想的说的，都是些不着边际的事，这是最让人讨厌的。在他查出病来之前，他曾跑县里，居然从教育局跑回一笔维修学校的款子，村子里只拿出了一小部分，想过节请个戏班子唱两天戏，结果让他搅了，楞从县里拉过个副县长来，让村里把钱拿回来，可当时戏台子都搭好了。学校倒是修了，但他扫了全村人的兴，以后的日子更难过。先是村里的电工，村长的侄子，把学校的电掐了，接着做饭取暖用的秸杆村里也不给了，害得他扔下自个的地下不了种，一人上山打柴，更别提后来拆校舍的房掾子那事了……这些磨擦力无所不在，让他心力交瘁，让他无法做匀速直线运动，他不得不停下来了。
    
    也许，他就要去的那个世界是没有磨擦力的，那里的一切都是光滑可爱的，但那有什么意义？在那边，他心仍留在这个充满灰尘和磨擦力的世界上，留在这所他倾注了全部生命的乡村小学里。他不在了以后，剩下了两个教师也会离去，这所他用力推了一辈子的小学校就会象谷场上那个石碾子一样停下来，他陷入深深的悲哀，但不论在这个世界或是那个世界，他都无力回天。
